N Duran, A. Paige, S D'Mello. Cognitive Science.

## What does this respository and README include?

> - R source code (.Rmd files) that provides a step-by-step tutorial of all statistical procedures 
>   - HTML output of executed R source code that reproduces results reported in manuscript   
> - Data codebook and variable descriptions used in source code to generate analysis

## R source code (.Rmd)

Each file contains the sequence of steps in R to generate the results, tables, and figures as reported in the manuscript. Detailed notes and annotations are included. Complete replication possible with access to the available source data files. 

> **Relevant Files:**
> - **Step1_CogSci_Features_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook takes raw output files from the ALIGN analysis and performs a clean-up to creates necessary variables for analysis, with a focus on creating the composite linguistic variables
> - **Step2_Optional_IndividDiff_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook adds optional individual difference measures to main datasheet
> - **Step3_CogSci_M1_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for replicating section in manuscript: Analysis 1: Alignment over time 
> - **Step3_CogSci_M2_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for replicating section in manuscript: Analysis 2: Alignment and CPS outcomes
> - **Step3_CogSci_Descriptives_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for computing level stats on relationship between # of turns, trophy completions, block, and verbosity
