# Multi-Level Linguistic Alignment in a Dynamic Collaborative Problem-Solving Task 
N Duran, A. Paige, S D'Mello. Cognitive Science.

## What does this respository and README include?

> - R source code (.Rmd files) that provides a step-by-step tutorial of all statistical procedures 
>   - Also, accompanying the HTML output is the executed Rmd source code that reproduces results reported in manuscript   
> - Data codebook and variable descriptions used in source code to generate analysis (NOT ADDED YET)

## R data analysis code (.Rmd)

Each file contains the sequence of steps in R to generate the results, tables, and figures as reported in the manuscript. Detailed notes and annotations are included. Complete replication possible with access to the available source data files. 

> **Relevant Files:**
> - **Step1_CogSci_Features_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook takes raw output files from the ALIGN analysis and performs a clean-up to creates necessary variables for analysis, with a focus on creating the composite linguistic variables
> - **Step2_Optional_IndividDiff_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook adds optional individual difference measures to main datasheet
> - **Step3_CogSci_M1_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for replicating section in manuscript: Analysis 1: Alignment over time 
> - **Step3_CogSci_M2_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for replicating section in manuscript: Analysis 2: Alignment and CPS outcomes
> - **Step3_CogSci_Descriptives_MASTER.Rmd**
>   - Notebook contains code for computing level stats on relationship between # of turns, trophy completions, block, and verbosity

## Accompanying Datasheets for Building New Variables

For the MASTER .Rmd files, and to build out the ALIGN raw data, it is necessary to import in other datasheets to add task variables and individual differences
